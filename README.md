# NFWF
Code and issues for the NERACOOS NFWF project

The goals of this project are to engage local data providers, find datasets that will be lost to a filing cabinet and make them available via standard services, help providers who have large collections of well organized data connect to standard services, increase public awareness of tools to access standards services, provide better access to data surrounding hurricanes and severe storms
